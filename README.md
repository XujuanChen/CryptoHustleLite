# Lab 5: Crypto Hustle Lite

# Overview

In this lab, you will develop an app that displays information about cryptocurrencies, 
such as their value, market cap, and percent change in value, 
which you will access using API calls. You will also implement 
a search bar that allows users to search for a specific currency.

Required Features

User can view a list of at least 30 cryptocurrencies, including the image, name, and price of the coin in US dollars

User can search for a specific coin in the list of cryptocurrencies by symbol

User can view a list of cryptocurrency scams on a separate pane in the page

# Goals

By the end of this lab you will be able to...

Create an API key

Read API documentation to understand how to make requests, either in GitHub docs or using the examples on the organizationâ€™s website

Use the useEffect() hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions

Fetch API data with async/await syntax

Use props to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases

Use conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, 
to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not

Additionally practice using CSS to format pages
